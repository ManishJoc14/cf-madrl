\section{Remaining Tasks}

This section lists work currently in progress or planned for completion.

\subsection{Hardware Integration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Assemble complete system: Raspberry Pi 4 + ESP32 + Camera + LED signals
    \item Implement communication protocol between Pi and ESP32 (UART/GPIO)
    \item Test signal control logic with yellow transition safety mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{End-to-End Pipeline Testing}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrate: Camera $\rightarrow$ YOLO detection $\rightarrow$ State construction $\rightarrow$ Policy inference $\rightarrow$ Signal control
    \item Validate observation format matches trained model expectations
    \item Measure total decision latency (target: $<200$ ms)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real-World Validation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deploy system on scaled physical intersection model
    \item Collect performance metrics: waiting time, queue length, throughput
    \item Compare against fixed-time baseline and simulation results
    \item Identify and address sim-to-real gap issues
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Finalize system architecture diagrams
    \item Document deployment procedures and configuration
    \item Prepare performance evaluation report with statistical analysis
\end{itemize}
