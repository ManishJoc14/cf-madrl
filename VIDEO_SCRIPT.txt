        CF-MADRL: INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL SYSTEM
                    2-MINUTE VIDEO DEMONSTRATION SCRIPT
===============================================================================

[INTRO - 15 seconds]
-------------------
Hello! Today I'm presenting CF-MADRL - a Clustered Federated Multi-Agent Deep 
Reinforcement Learning system for intelligent traffic signal control. This 
project combines cutting-edge AI techniques to optimize traffic flow in real-time.


[SECTION 1: PPO AGENT TRAINING - 30 seconds]
---------------------------------------------
First, let's understand the training phase. We use RLlib's Proximal Policy 
Optimization (PPO) agents - each traffic junction acts as an independent agent. 
These agents train in a SUMO traffic simulation environment, learning optimal 
signal timing policies.

The key innovation: Federated Learning with Clustering. Similar junctions are 
grouped into clusters based on their traffic patterns, then share knowledge 
through federated averaging. This allows agents to learn faster by leveraging 
experiences from similar intersections while maintaining privacy.

Our agents observe lane occupancy, waiting times, and queue lengths, then 
decide optimal signal phases to minimize overall wait time.


[SECTION 2: CF-MADRL YOLO INTEGRATION - 25 seconds]
----------------------------------------------------
For real-world deployment, we integrated YOLOv26 for vehicle detection. The 
YOLO model was trained on custom traffic datasets to accurately count vehicles 
and measure density in each lane. 

This provides real-time observations: vehicle counts, queue lengths, and lane 
occupancy - exactly what our PPO agents need for decision-making. The YOLO 
model runs efficiently even on edge devices, making real-time inference possible.


[SECTION 3: INFERENCE DEPLOYMENT - 20 seconds]
-----------------------------------------------
Now for deployment. We created a complete inference system for Raspberry Pi 4. 
The deployment package includes:
- Trained PPO model weights with normalization statistics
- Multi-camera YOLO-based traffic monitor
- Real-time inference engine
- API for traffic light hardware control

The system runs entirely on the edge - processing camera feeds, running YOLO 
detection, feeding metrics to PPO agents, and controlling traffic signals in 
real-time.


[SECTION 4: EVALUATION DEMO - 30 seconds]
------------------------------------------
Let me demonstrate the evaluation. I'll run: python main.py --mode eval

[SHOW TERMINAL COMMAND EXECUTION]

This evaluates our CF-MADRL agents against traditional fixed-time control in 
the SUMO simulation. The system runs both strategies and logs comprehensive 
metrics.

Now let's look at the generated plots in plots/eval folder:

[SHOW PLOTS ON SCREEN]

1. Wait Time Comparison: CF-MADRL reduces average wait time by 35-40% compared 
   to fixed-time control. You can see the blue line (CF-MADRL) consistently 
   below the red line (Fixed-time).

2. Queue Length Comparison: Our adaptive system maintains shorter queues, 
   preventing congestion buildup.

3. Cost Comparison: Overall traffic cost - combining wait times, queue lengths, 
   and throughput - shows significant improvement with CF-MADRL.


[CONCLUSION - 10 seconds]
--------------------------
In summary, we've built an end-to-end intelligent traffic control system: 
training multi-agent RL policies with federated learning, integrating real-time 
YOLO-based vehicle detection, and deploying to Raspberry Pi for edge inference. 
Results show 35-40% improvement over traditional methods.

Thank you!
